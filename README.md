# my neovim configuration

I mostly code in Rails and Javascript

I got motivated to switch to neovim when learning Rust. I improved my whole setup and aim to improve the Rust plugins shortly. I want to see the async compiler messages next to my code. Live.

TODO - list plugins and what they are for.

# my neovim configuration

I mostly code in Rails and Javascript

I got motivated to switch to neovim when learning Rust. I improved my whole setup and aim to improve the Rust plugins shortly. I want to see the async compiler messages next to my code. Live.

## Setup

1. Install neovim
  a. on Ubuntu: `sudo apt install nvim``
  b. on MacOS: ??? <<< probably with homebrew
2. Set up .bash_profile or .zshrc
3. Install neovim files from ~/.config directory: `git clone https://github.com/allesklar/nvim`

FIXME -- Plugins are not working on server 5

## TODO - list plugins and what they are for.
